This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked error in Tcl code related to file input/output operations.  The `bug.tcl` file contains code with insufficient error handling. The `bugSolution.tcl` provides an improved version with more robust error handling.  This example highlights the importance of comprehensive error checking when dealing with file I/O to prevent unexpected program termination or data corruption.
